# Piece 3.0

> Piece 3.0 is out on [App Store](https://piece.so) / [piece.so](https://piece.so)! The app is revamped with Swift and polished with a bunch of new features. Download it on [App Store](https://piece.so) and give it a try.

> Piece 1.0~2.0 were implemented with Electron five years ago during my college as a side project. Months ago, I finally got some time and decided to rewrite the whole app in Swift, with features that I found useful in my daily use. Here is the [backstory](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29311778) about the Swift rewrite, and [comparison](https://twitter.com/polchen_/status/1429224010852626440) on UI/UX, app size and memory usage between 2.0 (Electron) vs. 3.0 (Swift) in case you're interested.
