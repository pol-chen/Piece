## Less = More

The product philosophy of Piece is **LESS equals MORE**. It doesn’t matter where we put ours thoughts, ideas and to-dos down. What really counts is that we actually **do** that eventually - go back to my thoughts and work out some problems; continue my new idea and make it big; or just simply get everything listed done. The way how we put the pieces down should be as simple as possible. And this simple way, with your pieces is the **LESS**, which might bring your something **MORE** than you have imagined.

And this is what Piece do.
