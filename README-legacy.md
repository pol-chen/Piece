# [Piece](http://piece.bus1996.me)
A simple **temporary-note** taking app.

Now you could **list what you gonna do** the next day before you go to bed;

Or you could **write down some thoughts** temporarily while you are focusing on something else.

With @-handle and #-handle you could easily **highlight time, places, people and themes**.

Hope you like it :-D

## Less = More

The product philosophy of Piece is **LESS equals MORE**. It doesn’t matter where we put ours thoughts, ideas and to-dos down. What really counts is that we actually **do** that eventually - go back to my thoughts and work out some problems; continue my new idea and make it big; or just simply get everything listed done. The way how we put the pieces down should be as simple as possible. And this simple way, with your pieces is the **LESS**, which might bring your something **MORE** than you have imagined.

And this is what Piece do.
